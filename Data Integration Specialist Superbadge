1) store the remote system site in setup > remote site settings
2) to authenticate to external systems
store the credentials in setup > custom settings > serviceCredentials
3) to invoke external systems REST API endpoints
   store the credentials in
   setup > named credentials > create new one
 4) To create a new connected app in your salesforce org
    setup > app manager > new connected app > create new one
    after its created, copy the consumer key and consumer secret for the connected app
 5) go to the connected app, copy the consumer key annd secret and get the token
 6) now register the token in your salesforce org, in custom settings > service token
 7) go to the connected app and test the connections now, 
 
 Both salesforce and connected app has been integrated now, cool
 
 i dont know why iam using custom settings > serviceCredentials
 custom settings > serviceTokens should be passed in request header during making callouts
